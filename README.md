# Python-PortfolioProjects


**Image-Based Classification via CNN**  
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. It demonstrates proficiency in libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras, focusing on training models to identify and categorize images accurately.

**Banking Operations (OOP with KYC)**  
This project models banking operations and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It incorporates libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and employs RSA encryption for secure data handling, ensuring robust security practices in banking operations.

**Housing Prices Prediction Project**  
This project involves predicting housing prices using machine learning techniques. It uses libraries like Scikit-Learn for implementing regression models and feature engineering, as well as NumPy and Pandas for data processing.

**Payment Practices (Analysis with NLP and Federated Learning)**  
This project analyzes payment practices using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Federated Learning. It incorporates libraries like NLTK or SpaCy for text analysis and PySyft for federated learning, addressing complex data privacy and analytics challenges.
